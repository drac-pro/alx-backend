# 0x03. Queuing System in JS

This project focuses on implementing a queuing system using Redis and Kue in a Node.js environment. The primary objectives are to understand how to work with Redis for storing and retrieving data, manage async operations, and build a simple Express application that interacts with both a Redis server and a queue system.

## Objectives

- **Run a Redis Server**: Learn how to install and run a Redis server locally on your machine.
- **Basic Redis Operations**: Perform simple operations using the Redis client in Node.js.
- **Hash Values in Redis**: Understand how to store and manipulate hash values within Redis.
- **Async Operations with Redis**: Manage asynchronous operations while interacting with Redis.
- **Queue System with Kue**: Implement a basic queue system using Kue and Redis.
- **Express and Redis Integration**: Build a simple Express application that interacts with a Redis server for basic operations.
- **Express, Redis, and Queue Integration**: Extend the Express application to also interact with a queue system using Kue.
